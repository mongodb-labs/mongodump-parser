# mongodump-parser

This Repository is **NOT** an officially supported MongoDB product.

This simple tool reads a
[mongodump](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/database-tools/mongodump/) archive
on its standard input, parses the archiveâ€™s header & collection metadata,
then writes the result as a JSON document to standard output.

To build it, just run `go build`.
